# Down

This is pretty much a demo of what i can do in around three to four days of free time. I was hoping to rewrite most of the OneHappyEnding project code so i could make some kind of lib/framework of my own on top of Libgdx and i did it! This time i think my code is pretty clean and easy to use, as a matter of fact it was very fun to make this.
